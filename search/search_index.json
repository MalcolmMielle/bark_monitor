The recordings are saved in a folder to enable you to really show that neighbor they are full of shit.</li> <li>Monitor its barking real time and send you notification through a Telegram bot when your neighbor drives the dog crazy and they barks.   Detection of the bark can be done using the Yamnet neural network implemented in tensorflow, or the amplitude of the signal.   Using Yamnet, cats are also tracked ;).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"install/","title":"Install","text":"<p>The bark monitor relies on pyaudio and portaudio. Start by installing gcc/g++ and portaudio. On Ubuntu:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev\n</code></pre> <p>Install with tensorflow for Deep Learning based detection using Yamnet:</p> <p><code>pip install .[ml]</code></p> <p>Install without tensorflow to use amplitude based detection:</p> <p><code>pip install .</code></p> <p>Tested with python 3.9, should work with higher versions too.</p> <p>To run the unit tests and be able to contribute, install the package in editable mode using the <code>-e</code> option for pip.</p>"}]}

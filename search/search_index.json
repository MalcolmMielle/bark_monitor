Do you want to know if your dog is actually noisy when you are gone but you don't (and don't want to buy) a baby cam?</p> <p>Then this project is for you!</p> <p>The bark monitor will:</p> <ul> <li>Record your dog while you are gone.   The recordings are saved in a folder to enable you to really show that neighbor they are full of shit.</li> <li>Monitor its barking real time and send you notification through a Telegram bot when your neighbor drives the dog crazy and they barks.   Detection of the bark can be done using the Yamnet neural network implemented in tensorflow, or the amplitude of the signal.   Using Yamnet, cats are also tracked ;).</li> </ul> <p>Install the bark monitor and start recording your dog today :).</p>"},{"location":"google_sync/","title":"Sync with google drive","text":"<p>It is possible to save the recordings to google drive automatically although the feature is very experimental.</p> <p>When used, the config file of dog activities and recording time will be safe and \"sync\" with your google drive as a json.</p> <p>On the other hand, audio recordings also will be saved but the code will erase current audio saved on the drive!
